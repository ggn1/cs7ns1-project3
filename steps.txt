1. We need to replace IP with some ICN like NDN (layer 2).
    # We can implement our own NDN protocol from scratch.
    # This would mean creating custom data packets.
        # We can create layer 2 only packets using the Scapy library.
    # To receive these packets though, we'd need to listen on raw sockets.
        # Creating raw sockets are possible on Linux but only if the python file 
          is ran with root priviledges (sudo), which we cannot do on the Pi.
        # There is a hack around this @ https://python-forum.io/thread-12921.html.
          # This works in the WSL on local machine but not on the Pi due to dafety measures in place.
    # Conclusion = Build NDN over IP.
2. We need a node that is both able to listen for message and send messages as well. 
   This node should contain CS, PIT and FIB tables for routing and forwarding.
