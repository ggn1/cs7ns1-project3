ICN Principles
==============
1. Packets do not contain location information. They only contain information about packet contents.
2. Communication occurs via a pull-based model where it is the consumer of a packet that controls the communication.
3. Communications are connection less.
4. In-network forwarding decisions are dynamic.
5. There is in-network storage.
