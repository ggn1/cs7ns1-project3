Peer to peer (P2P) networks have the following characteristics.
- All nodes/peers act as both clients and servers.
- Data is fragmented and distributed among all peers. That is, each peer has a small part of total data.
- Peers request missing data fragments from other peers in the network to complete a file and get the full picture.
