PROJECT STEPS
=============

1. Get a concept and plan together. What to try to implement and emulate?

2. What types of data need to pass between the nodes or devices?

3. Have something listening on particular port(s) for incoming connections from other devices, and be able to make connections to other devices.

4. Interest Discovery: How should discovery and routing work?
    * Information Centric Routing and/or Named Data Routing.
    * Some parallels with P2P concepts where nodes need to know what a neighbour can do, is interested in, and some part of what they know.
