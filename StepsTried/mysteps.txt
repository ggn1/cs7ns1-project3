1. We need to replace IP with some ICN like NDN (layer 2).
    # We can implement our own NDN protocol from scratch.
    # This would mean creating custom data packets.
        # We can create layer 2 only packets using the Scapy library.
    # To receive these packets though, we'd need to listen on war sockets.
        # 
2. We need some transport protocol like TCP that works with NDN.
